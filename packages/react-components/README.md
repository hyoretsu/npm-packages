## A collection of React components, either made or curated by me

- **`Button`**
- **`GlowingBlur`**
- **`Input`** – A powerful `<input />` component (actually enforces min/max values and maxLength)
- **`Link`** – A multi-purpose Link modification for Next.js, switching automatically between the stock `<Link />` and safe `<a />`
- **`Modal`**
- **`OpacityFilter`** – A filter to darken the entire screen
- **`TextRing`** – Circles a given text in a given radius
- **`SvgGradient`** – A little util for when you want to set a SVG's color to gradient. Pass an ID as a prop and use `url("#your-id")` as either `fill` or `stroke`

### Visual effects

- **`Sonar`** – Adds a sonar effect to any component
