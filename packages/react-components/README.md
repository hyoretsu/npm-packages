## A collection of React components, either made or curated by me

- **`Button`**
- **`Input`** - A powerful `<input />` component (actually enforces min/max values and maxLength)
- **`Link`** - A multi-purpose Link modification for Next.js, switching automatically between the stock `<Link />` and safe `<a />`
- **`Modal`**
- **`OpacityFilter`** - A filter to darken the entire screen
- **`TextRing`** - Circles a given text in a given radius
